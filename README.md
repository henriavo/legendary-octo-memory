# Description of the problem and solution

Build both front end and back end to a standardized clinical assessment in a multiple-choice questionnaire format that determines symptom severity for several disorders. 

Leveraging my recent experience with sveltkit framework. A frontend web interface  prompts the user one question at a time and will subit all responses to the included backend API. 

# Reasoning behind your technical choices

# Describe how you would deploy this as a true production app on the platform of your choice: 

- How would ensure the application is highly available and performs well?

- How would you secure it?

- What would you add to make it easier to troubleshoot problems while it is running live?

- Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project
